## Development configurations 

As I work on my macbook but for personal use I use Linux this repo is where I share configuration files. The shell setup is undecided as I have multiple versions.

- Vscode settings are heavy modified with animatios and theming.
- .Cursor settings instructions text is tailored towards how I like to structure my NextJS applications.

## Todo

- Terminal configuration 
    - Ghostty 
    - Wezterm
    - Warp

- Port vscode settings and keybindings over to PhpStorm.

- Create karabiner or other keybindings configurations for OSX.

- Create sections for re-usable snippets which are gitignored

- Try to move brew over to Nix to have 1:1 linux vs osx support
