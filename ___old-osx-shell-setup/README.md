## Macbook - OSX .zshrc setup

Still a work in progress. scripts, aliasses and loads of functions are not complete and somewhere in the source train there are some problems. General structure is how I want it tho.

The idea is that you have your main `.zshrc` which sources the `main_injector.sh` and that sources individual subjects e.g. aliasses, scripts, or whatever you want. In lines of seperate of concerns/SOLID architecture.
